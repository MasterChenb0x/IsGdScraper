# IsGdScraper

### DESCRIPTION
This project scrapes is.gd links for a project on security analysis. It is not the author's intention to use information gained with this project in a malicous manner. Insights into findings will be released upon the final presentation.


### CHANGELOG

###### 2017-02-01
Revamped the way the datamining works.
Added isgd.py and isgd.sh.
Added proxy_scraper.php, but I did not write this file. It was written by a friend for a separate project, but the functionality applies here.
The scrape is now done through a proxy setup for potentially faster scraping without a constant hammer from one IP.
That should have been implemented from the beginning, but this is a learning process.
Initiate by ./isgd.py

###### 2017-01-17
Successfully feeding generated links through url-resolve.sh

###### 2017-01-15
Initialization.
Link generation success!
Need to take generated links through a web scraper.
